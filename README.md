# NinjaZombieScroller_v0.1 (working title)

This is the start of a side-scrolling Android game app. Currently, it involves a ninja player slicing through a continuous stream of zombies. It is still in development as there are a number of problems that need to be fixed, mainly with the state changing.

The app uses a joystick api for navigation with a simple circle view as an action button at the moment. All artwork was found online from open resources.

As it stands now, all aspects (for the most part) scale with the screen size.
